# Neurotopological Collapse in Epilepsy: Code and Resources

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper: **"Collapse of Complexity in Epileptic Seizures: A Neurotopological Analysis with Entropy, Homology, and Ricci Curvature"** by Arturo Salazar Chon.

The objective of this work is to demonstrate that an epileptic seizure is characterized by a collapse of the brain's dynamic and structural complexity, representing a state of pathological order rather than disorder.
