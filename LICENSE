1. PROPRIETARY DATA ONLY
This repository contains raw datasets (.csv) and visual outputs (images) generated by the Sovereign BFG Engine. The source code, algorithms, and underlying computational methods are NOT included in this repository and remain the exclusive, confidential, and proprietary intellectual property of Arturo Salazar Chon.

2. NO REVERSE ENGINEERING
Users are strictly prohibited from attempting to:

Reconstruct, reverse-engineer, or derive the logic, mechanics, or source code of the Sovereign Engine from the provided datasets or visualizations.

Use these datasets to train machine learning models, neural networks, or any AI-based system intended to replicate the engine's functionality.

Decompile or de-anonymize the mathematical structures (Ricci/Betti/Phi) for the purpose of cloning the simulation environment.

3. LIMITED LICENSE FOR AUDIT PURPOSES
The data provided here is for validation and peer-review auditing only.

Permitted Use: Analyzing the results to verify the scientific claims regarding neurotopological stability and quantum decoherence.

Prohibited Use: Any commercial use, redistribution of data as part of another software package, or use in patent applications by third parties is strictly forbidden.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE
The computational methods used to generate these data—specifically the integration of Non-Euclidean Topology as an entropy-dissipation mechanism for quantum states—are PATENT PENDING. Unauthorized use of these methods will be prosecuted under international intellectual property laws.
